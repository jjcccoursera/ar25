When Flask runs with flask run, it‚Äôs great for development ‚Äî but it's not intended for public traffic. That‚Äôs where a reverse proxy like Nginx (or Caddy) comes in.

Here‚Äôs what that means and why it matters:
üí° Why use a reverse proxy?

    Handles HTTPS: Automatically gets and renews SSL certificates using Let‚Äôs Encrypt.

    Forwards traffic: Public requests to https://your-domain.com are passed to your internal Flask app running on localhost:5000.

    Improves reliability: Can restart the app if it crashes (via Gunicorn or similar).

    Boosts performance: Caches static assets like JS/CSS/images.

‚öôÔ∏è What the setup looks like

    Your Flask app runs on the VPS at something like localhost:5000.

    Nginx listens on port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) to the outside world.

    Nginx forwards requests to Flask (via a WSGI server like gunicorn).

    Visitors see a secure, fast web app at your-domain.com.

A virtual environment ‚Äî or venv ‚Äî is like giving your project its own little Python universe. It keeps your app‚Äôs dependencies isolated from your system Python, which is great for avoiding version clashes and for clean deployment later on.

Here's how to set one up inside your AR25PORT folder:
üõ† Create and activate a venv
cd ~/AR25PORT
python3 -m venv venv        # Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
source venv/bin/activate    # Activate it

how to exit venv

Just a quick deactivate will do the trick

-----

So from Cloud Shell, the command to copy your project folder over should be:

scp -r ~/AR25PORT admin@193.181.208.117:~

This will copy the entire AR25PORT folder into the admin user's home directory on your Webdock server.

scp ar25port.zip admin@jc.vps.webdock.cloud:~

 Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy

This will:

    Route external HTTP requests to your Flask app via Gunicorn

    Serve static files if needed

    Allow you to secure the site with HTTPS (soon)

Let‚Äôs do this:

1. Install Nginx
sudo apt install nginx

2. Create an Nginx config for your app
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/ar25port

Paste this config (replace jc.vps.webdock.cloud with your real domain or use your IP for now):

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name jc.vps.webdock.cloud;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}

 Enable the site and restart Nginx

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/ar25port /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx

Let‚Äôs get SSL with Let‚Äôs Encrypt

Best part? It‚Äôs free and easy with a tool called Certbot. You install it, run it once, and it:

    Gets a free certificate from Let‚Äôs Encrypt

    Configures Nginx to use it

    Sets up automatic renewal

Here‚Äôs how it works:

üß™ Step 1: Install Certbot & Nginx plugin

sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

Step 2: Run Certbot

Assuming your domain (jc.vps.webdock.cloud) points to this server:

sudo certbot --nginx -d jc.vps.webdock.cloud

 Step 3: Confirm auto-renewal

Certbot adds a cron job or systemd timer automatically, but you can test it manually:

sudo certbot renew --dry-run

If you ever want to check the cert status:

sudo certbot certificates

Why run Gunicorn as a systemd daemon?

Right now, you're starting Gunicorn manually with:

gunicorn -w 4 -b 127.0.0.1:5000 main:app

That works fine‚Ä¶ until:

    The server reboots

    You close the terminal or lose SSH

    Gunicorn crashes for any reason

With a background service (via systemd), Gunicorn becomes a self-managing process. That means:

    ‚úÖ Starts automatically on boot

    ‚úÖ Restarts on failure

    ‚úÖ Runs quietly in the background

    ‚úÖ You can control it like this:

sudo systemctl start gunicorn
sudo systemctl stop gunicorn
sudo systemctl status gunicorn

 Step 1: Create a gunicorn.service file

We‚Äôll tell systemd how to launch and manage Gunicorn. Run:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service

    [Unit]
    Description=Gunicorn for ar25port
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=admin
    Group=www-data
    WorkingDirectory=/home/admin/ar25port
    Environment="PATH=/home/admin/ar25port/venv/bin"
    ExecStart=/home/admin/ar25port/venv/bin/gunicorn -w 4 -b 127.0.0.1:5000 main:app

    Restart=always
    RestartSec=3

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Step 2: Start and enable it

Now activate the service:

sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start gunicorn
sudo systemctl enable gunicorn
sudo systemctl status gunicorn
